About Project:

 This project is a dynamic online bread store developed using PHP and MySQL. The website allows users to register and log in to manage their personal accounts, browse through a variety of bread products, and view detailed information about each item. Users can search for products based on specific criteria, add selected items to their shopping cart, update quantities, or remove products before proceeding to checkout. Once an order is placed, users can review their purchase history, edit their profile information, and change their password when needed. The system also includes an admin panel where administrators can manage all data within the website, including products, users, and orders. In addition to the shopping features, the website provides supporting pages such as news and contact to improve the overall user experience and make the platform more interactive and informative.
